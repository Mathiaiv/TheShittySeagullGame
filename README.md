# TheShittySeagullGame
The perfect game when you just want to shit on the world.

MVP for the shitty seagull game:
* city 2D
* camera follows the seagull, but is the same orientation
* people
  * pathfinding goes along sidewalk
  * comes out of and goes into buildings


* poop is important
  * poop bar
    * goes down when pooping
    * goes up over time
* shadow
* seagull fly:
  * velocity
    * change direction gradually  with arrows (the direction according to the screen)
  * able to change speed
    * shift and control
  * a turn animation when reaching the edge of the map
    * if we donâ€™t have time for the animation, the seagull can go out of the screen and return a second later
